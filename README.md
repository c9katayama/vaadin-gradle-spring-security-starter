# Vaadin-Gradle-Spring-Security-Starter

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application with Gradle, Spring Boot and Spring Security.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

## Running the application

The project is a standard Gradle project. To run it from the command line,
type `gradlew` (Windows), or `./gradlew` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can login the app with admin/admin or user/user.
This application provides different menus according to the privileges of the logged-in user.The role settings are set into the src/main/resources/data.sql.
If you want to add a new user, you can user GenerateSQLForNewUser.java to generate SQLs for the new user, then add the SQLs to data.sql file.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `gradlew clean build` (Windows),
or `./gradlew clean build` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/vaadin-gradle-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
